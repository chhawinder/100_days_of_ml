instance based model and model based learning

instance based learning: cramming the concept
  we try to find a similar point near the testing data 
  and then we make a decision ex:knn k nearest neighbour 
  ->there is no learning in this method 
  ->all the result is fetched from the given data
  
model based learning 
  try to understand the data and then present some relation between output and input
  ex: linear regresion ,decison tree
  we make a new rule on the data that has been provided
  ->we need to just keep the relation not the data
