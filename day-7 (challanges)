Problens:
data collection:
  api fetch
  webscraping from google 

Insufficient data :
  data should be high to again better result
  labelled data is better

non representative data:
 ->sampling noise 
 ->sampling bias 
 ->data representation should not miss the data

poor quality data 
   ->we spend a lot of time in improving the data quality 
   

irrelevant Features
   ->garbage in garbage will be output 
   ->irrelevant data should not be used 
overfitting 
   ->cram the data
   ->can work only on old data 
underfitting 
   ->not good as give very bad result 
   
software integration 
   ->this is a very difficult process 
   
offline learning and deployment:
   ->costly process 
  
cost involved:
   ->ml can cost really high
