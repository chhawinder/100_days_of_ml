tensor:
this is a data structer (container for numbers)
  ->this is a basic ds for machine learning 

# 0d tensor:
{0}  this is an array in which there is only one number
  import numpy as np
  a=np.array(4)
  a
  ->output: array(4)
  a.ndim
  ->0
  
# 1d tensor
{0,1,2,3}
->dim=axis=rank 
  ->above given is one d
  ->but this vector has 4d 
  
# 2d tensor 
{
  [1,2,3]
  [2,6,5]
  [5,8,9]
}
shape:(3,3) 

#3d tensor

#4d tesnsor:
collection of 3d tensor and nd is generalize
