So Today i learned the basic diffrence between ai/ml/dl

  so basically ai is aritificial inteligence that means .. we are trying to make machines equal to human.. that can be simply stated as we are 
  trying to make machine self learners, having emotions learn patterns and all other human like inteligence

    then we learned about ml
    machine learning is just a subpart of ai and in this we follow the pattern and we give some specifications on which our model is trained and then further results are
    generated

    then we learned about dl
    deep learning is futher subpart of ml and is a very strong component and it learns itself and gets all the summary by itself as soon as data is provided to it


    so ml and dl both are very important crucial these days and it has been almost 5 years that this topic is booming so now next day we will probably start learning
