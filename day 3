types of machine learning

  supervised

  in this kind of ml we have some input data and some output data and all we have to do is 
  form a relationship between input and output result so that if any new data is thrown to us we can 
  predict the result

  there are 2 types of data : numerical :cgpa age wt iq ets
                              categorical:gender nationality

  2 types:
  regresion: when the output is of type numerical data it is callled regersion
  cassification:when the output is of tyoe categorical then it is cassification.  
  


  unsupervised

    in this type of learning we only we have input data

    types:
    clustering : labeles data can be creates we group the data
    dimentionality reduction: in case of a lot of input col ... it removes dimwnaion of data(pca->converts multidemesion to 3d state)
    anomaly detection:detect outliers and remove it 
    association rule learning : we notice a pattern that if 2 products are bought together then they should be kept together




  semi supervised :
      we give limited lables and then ml lables other things by its inteligence and give the output
      example google pic that is if we label one pic as papa then it lables all the pics of papa 

  reenforcement    :

we have zero data and we fetch data by working.. it learn by doing mistakes and then finally get well trained
